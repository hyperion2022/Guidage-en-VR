= Advanced Tracking

Est-il possible d'obtenir un alignement parfait de l'image couleur et infrarouge ?

[ ] Use min-max on infrared to boost contrast dynamically
[X] Do not start new analysis before the previous one is finished
[/] Keep track of was is being correctly tracked and interpolate
[/] Use kinect dept and infra red to power up the baracuda input
[ ] Add softening layer on kinect tracking, like considering inertia
